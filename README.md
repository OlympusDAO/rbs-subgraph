# Range-Bound Stability Subgraph

## Purpose

This repository contains code to deploy a subgraph that indexes events related to OlympusDAO's Range-Bound Stability.

## Contracts

This subgraph indexes events from the following contracts:

- Range
- Price

Where relevant, additional data/context from the contract is included in the indexed data.

It currently indexes the contracts on the Goerli testnet. However, it will be shifted to Ethereum mainnet upon final deployment.

## Subgraph

It is published at: <https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/olympusdao/rbs>
